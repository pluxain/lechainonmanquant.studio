# Le cha√Ænon manquant Studio

## Setup

A simple website built with [Astro](https://astro.build) using an [opinionated starter](https://github.com/pluxain/astro-starter).

It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) to define how it looks.

It uses [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) to translate what it has to say.

It uses [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) to send what users have to say.

## i18n/l10n

The default language is english.

By convention, punctuation signs are not included in the localizations but rather defined in the templates.
