This is the summary on my resume.

The first time I did code something was a button on an old VB editor on Windows. The one where you would almost do everything with the User Interface (UI): select a value for a property in a dropdown, drag a database connection component on a visual window component, etc.

This button's click would just change the color of the background of the system window which was embedding it; from blue to red or something.

This, just this, totally blew my mind. I knew what was happening, why, how and when. I could also change it: blue to green! I was in love with this. That was 25 years ago. The flame is still vivid.

25 years of experience does not mean a lot in Software Development in my humble opinion (IMHO). To be honest, I cannot remember what or how I coded something a couple of months ago, and I would probably do it differently today!

But it means a lot actually: I traveled a lot of "land", discovered a lot of different cultures , embraced various techniques, learned different languages, tried many processes and methodologies, fought with frameworks, built a lot of things.

This experience has enabled me to acquire a sharp sense of product management (PM), how to drive an idea into a project into a product and realize it. What I am saying is: I do not only do Software Development (SD), I can also offer advice, training and help in finding the right methodology and tools.

I think multilingual from scratch, I try to avoid unnecessary complexity as much as possible by breaking down features to smaller chunks or even challenge features! There is already so much bullshit out there that we do not need and did not ask for...

Please do not hesitate to contact me ! You can do so on the [contact page](/en/contact) or by sending me an email at [pascal@lechainonmanquant.studio](mailto:pascal@lechainonmanquant.studio).

I am already looking forward to hearing your great ideas and helping you make them a reality.

Pascal, your missing link.
